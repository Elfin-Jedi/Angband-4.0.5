To-do (so far, this branch (a reminder for myself)):


Finish uploading edit files with normal line endings: object.txt.

Add level 6 monsters from Unangband.

Add BR_CONF for Giant Bronze Dragon Flies.

-------------------------------------

Start adding player spells from FAangband that aren't easily made from existing effects.

(Mage Book #1) Fix Reduce Cuts and Poison - add a message for TIMED_DEC:CUT so it is clear that it has reduced cuts.

(Mage Book #1) Add/Fix Resist Magic - TIMED_INVULN has an entirely different effect in Vanilla.

(Mage Book #2) Add Telekinesis.

(Mage Book #2) Add Magical Throw.

Add Magic Book for Mages #3.

Add all the other books.

-------------------------------------

Figure out why new spellbooks don't display in inventory and shop lists, fix.

Find out how to fix monster invisibility spell, so the invisible monster can't be detected by detect monsters, displays 2nd message ({monster} disappears!), and reappears again.

Add sexes back in to birth choices.

Add framework for special abilities like Zangband-descended variants.

Start attempting to add terrain from Unangband.
