Angband 4.0.5
=============

Angband is a graphical dungeon adventure game that uses textual characters
to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, 
in the vein of games like NetHack and Rogue.  If you need help in-game,
press '?'.

For more information, somewhere to upload your characters and screenshots,
and discuss the game, try http://angband.oook.cz/.

If you're compiling the game yourself, read http://trac.rephial.org/wiki/Compiling.

Enjoy!

To-do (so far, this branch (a reminder for myself)):

(Mage Book #1) Fix Reduce Cuts and Poison, add a message for TIMED_DEC:CUT so it is clear that it has reduced cuts.

(Mage Book #1) Add/Fix Resist Magic (TIMED_INVULN has an entirely different effect in Vanilla.)

(Mage Book #2) Add Telekinesis.

(Mage Book #2) Add Magical Throw.

Add Magic Book for Mages #3.

Add all the other books.
