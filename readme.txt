Angband 4.0.5
=============

Angband is a graphical dungeon adventure game that uses textual characters
to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, 
in the vein of games like NetHack and Rogue.  If you need help in-game,
press '?'.

For more information, somewhere to upload your characters and screenshots,
and discuss the game, try http://angband.oook.cz/.

If you're compiling the game yourself, read http://trac.rephial.org/wiki/Compiling.

Enjoy!

To-do (eventually (a reminder for myself)):

Finish uploading edit files with normal line endings: object.txt, object-base.txt, p-race.txt.

Add rest of level 5 monsters from Unangband.

Change Ranger, Druid, Necromancer, and Assassin spells to match Oangband.

Add player races from Faangband.

Start Adding Poschengband races.

Add Poschangband style race-type list.

Figure out why new spellbooks don't display in inventory and shop lists, fix.

Find out how to fix monster invisibility spell, so the invisible monster can't be detected by detect monsters, displays 2nd message ({monster} disappears!), and reappears again.

Add sexes back in to birth choices.

Start adding player spells from Oangband that aren't easily made from existing effects.

Add framework for special abilities like Zangband-descended variants.

Start attempting to add terrain from Unangband.
