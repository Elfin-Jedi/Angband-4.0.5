Angband 4.0.5
=============

Angband is a graphical dungeon adventure game that uses textual characters
to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, 
in the vein of games like NetHack and Rogue.  If you need help in-game,
press '?'.

For more information, somewhere to upload your characters and screenshots,
and discuss the game, try http://angband.oook.cz/.

If you're compiling the game yourself, read http://trac.rephial.org/wiki/Compiling.

Enjoy!

---------------------------------------

To-do (eventually (a reminder for myself)):

Upload edited monster-base.txt.

Disable monster invisibility spell. (It was making it so Grip, Farmer Maggot's Dog could only be seen with Detect Monsters. Even Detect Invisible wouldn't do it.)

Finish uploading edit files with normal line endings: object.txt, object-base.txt, p-race.txt.

Figure out why new spellbooks don't display in inventory and shop lists, fix.

Find out how to fix monster invisibility spell, so the invisible monster can't be detected by detect monsters, displays 2nd message ({monster} disappears!), and reappears again.

Change Ranger, Druid, Necromancer, and Assassin spells to match Oangband.

Add rest of level 5 monsters from Unangband.

Add sexes back in to birth choices, also add Poschangband style race-type list.

Add player races from Faangband.

Start adding player spells from Oangband that aren't easily made from existing effects.

Add framework for special abilities like Zangband-descended variants.

Start Adding Poschengband races.

Start attempting to add terrain from Unangband.
