Angband 4.0.5
=============

Angband is a graphical dungeon adventure game that uses textual characters
to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, 
in the vein of games like NetHack and Rogue.  If you need help in-game,
press '?'.

For more information, somewhere to upload your characters and screenshots,
and discuss the game, try http://angband.oook.cz/.

If you're compiling the game yourself, read http://trac.rephial.org/wiki/Compiling.

Enjoy!

---------------------------------------

To-do (eventually (a reminder for myself)):

Figure out why new spellbooks don't display in inventory and shop lists, fix.

Find out how to fix monster invisibility spell, so the monster both disappears/can't be detected by detect monsters, and displays 2nd message ({monster} disappears!)

Finish uploading edit files with normal line endings: object.txt, object-base.txt, p-race.txt.

Add fire and cold resists to Fire and Frost Giants.

Change Priest, Rogue, Ranger, Druid, Necromancer, and Assassin spells to match Oangband.

Add rest of level 5 monsters from Unangband.

Add sexes back in to birth choices, also add Poschangband style race-type list.

Add player races from Faangband.

Start adding player spells from Oangband that aren't easily made from existing effects.

Add framework for special abilities like Zangband-descended variants.

Start Adding Poschengband races.

Start attempting to add terrain from Unangband.
